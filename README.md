📍 Conclusion
This HR Attrition Dashboard reveals clear patterns of employee turnover, especially among female Sales Representatives. Key findings include:
-Sales Representatives have the highest attrition rate, with single women being the most affected group (up to 100% in some segments).
-Marital status, business travel, and work-life balance strongly influence attrition—but improving work-life balance alone is not sufficient for retention among single employees.
-Income disparities, frequent travel, and lack of growth or support structures may contribute to this trend.

💡 Recommendations for HR
To reduce attrition and foster a more supportive work environment, HR should:
-Provide targeted support for high-risk groups (e.g., single female Sales Representatives), including personalized career paths, mentorship, and mental health resources.
-Reevaluate business travel policies—especially for employees with high travel frequency—to promote better work-life integration.
-Ensure equitable compensation and transparent advancement opportunities to improve motivation and retention.
-Promote inclusive culture and emotional support systems tailored to diverse employee backgrounds and life situations.
-Use predictive attrition models to proactively identify and support at-risk employees.
By addressing these factors, HR can enhance employee satisfaction, reduce turnover, and create a more resilient workforce.
